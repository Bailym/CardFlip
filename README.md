# CardFlip
A Winforms game I made a long time ago. Based on Voltorb flip from Pokemon HGSS

**Details**
- WinForms
- C#


**Features**
- Randomly generated grid of tiles
- Clicking a tile reveals its number
- Score counter
- If a tile contains a bomb (0) game is ended.
- Marking suspected bomb tiles in green.
